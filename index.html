            Yes I do, I believe
            That one day I will be, where I was
            Right there, right next to you
            And it's hard. Yes I do, I believe
            That one day I will be, where I was
            Right there, right next to you
            And it's hard, the days just seem so dark
            The moon, the stars, are nothing without you
            Your touch, your skin, where do I begin?
            No words can explain, the way I'm missing you
            The night, this emptiness
            This hole that I'm inside
            These tears, they tell their own story
            You told me not to cry when you were gone
            But the feeling's overwhelming
            It's much too strong
            Can I lay by your side, next to you, you
            And make sure you're alright
            I'll take care of you

            This hurt that I've been through
            I'm missing you, missing you like crazy
            You told me not to cry when you were gone
            But the feeling's overwhelming
            It's much too strong
            Can I lay by your side, next to you, you
            And make sure you're alright
            I'll take care of you
            And I don't wanna be here if
            I can't be with you tonight
            Lay me down tonight, lay me by your side

            Yes I do, I believe
            That one day I will be, where I was
            Right there, right next to you
            And it's hard, the days just seem so dark
            The moon, the stars, are nothing without you
            Your touch, your skin, where do I begin?
            No words can explain, the way I'm missing you
            The night, this emptiness
            This hole that I'm inside
            These tears, they tell their own story
            You told me not to cry when you were gone

            I'll take care of you
            And I don't wanna be here if
            I can't be with you tonight
            Lay me down tonight, lay me by your side
            Lay me down tonight, lay me by your side
            Can I lay by your side, next to you, you-ou

            The moon, the stars, are nothing without you
            Your touch, your skin, where do I begin?
            No words can explain, the way I'm missing you
            The night, this emptiness
            This hole that I'm inside
            These tears, they tell their own story
            You told me not to cry when you were gone

            Lay me down tonight, lay me by your side
            Can I lay by your side, next to you, you-ou
            And make sure you're alright
            I'll take care of you
            And I don't wanna be here if
            I can't be with you tonight
            Yes I do, I believe
            That one day I will be, where I was
            Right there, right next to you
            And it's hard, the days just seem so dark
            The moon, the stars, are nothing without you
            Your touch, your skin, where do I begin?
            No words can explain, the way I'm missing you
            The night, this emptiness
            This hole that I'm inside
            These tears, they tell their own story
            You told me not to cry when you were gone
            But the feeling's overwhelming
            It's much too strong
            Can I lay by your side, next to you, you
            And make sure you're alright
            I'll take care of you
            And I don't want to be here if
            I can't be with you tonight
            I'm reaching out to you
            Can you hear my call?
            (Who's to say you won't hear me?)
            This hurt that I've been through
            I'm missing you, missing you like crazy
            You told me not to cry when you were gone
            But the feeling's overwhelming
            It's much too strong
            Can I lay by your side, next to you, you
            And make sure you're alright
            I'll take care of you
            And I don't wanna be here if
            I can't be with you tonight
            Lay me down tonight, lay me by your side
